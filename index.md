title: A lecture on statistical power
---

This website contains information for my lecture on statistical power in the UNC School of Pharmacy.

## Before class

Please complete all of these items before class. The in-class portion will assume you have processed the items enough to ask quesions about them.

* Read [this handout](handout.pdf)
* If you're new to using `R`, watch [this video](https://uncch.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=7915ff30-58ee-4519-9b1d-ac8300ede6f2) to get started.
* Watch this video on calculating power via simulations using the `simglm` package in `R`. The script shown in the video can be found here.

## During class

Learning objectives:

1. List the components of power and explain how changing each component, keeping all others equal, affects power.
2. Describe the limitations of using only power to design a study.
3. Using R, calculate power / required sample size for a t-test, ANOVA, ANCOVA, and logistic regression model.

We will use polls, question and answer, and group active learning to achieve these objectives.
