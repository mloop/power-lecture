title: A lecture on statistical power
---

This website contains information for my lecture on statistical power in the UNC School of Pharmacy.

## Before class

Please complete all of these items before class. The in-class portion will assume you have processed the items enough to ask quesions about them.

1. Read [this handout](handout.pdf)
2 If you're new to using `R`, watch [this video](https://uncch.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=7915ff30-58ee-4519-9b1d-ac8300ede6f2) to download R and Rstudio, as well as perform some quick analysis.
3. Watch [this video](https://uncch.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=3e140a97-5bf5-4a79-a8fa-adaa00fa637c) on calculating power via simulations using the `simglm` package in `R`. While watching the video, run the code in the [script](simglm_example.R) to make sure the simglm package is working.

## During class

Learning objectives:

1. List the components of power and explain how changing each component, keeping all others equal, affects power.
2. Describe the limitations of using only power to design a study.
3. Using R, calculate statistical power for a linear regression model.

We will use polls, lecture, question and answer, and group active learning to achieve these objectives.

The slides can be found [here](slides.pdf).

For the active learning activity on calculating power using `simglm`, you can use [this template](power_calculation_active_learning.R) to get started.
